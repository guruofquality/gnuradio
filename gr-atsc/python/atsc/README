Decoding ATSC using 19.2MSps rate over 5 processes
--------------------------------------------------

1) Verify signal, adjust antenna and find best gain setting using uhd_fft.py,
station frequency from the fcc video database, and sample rate to 6.4e6.

2) Capture data - adjust gain (-g) frequency (-f) and which side
the tvrx is on to fit your local setup:

uhd_rx_cfile.py -s --samp-rate=6.4e6 -g 65 -f 503e6 atsc_data_6-4m_complex

You probably still need fast disks to take the data, like a raid-0 set of
striped sata drives. Make sure there are no or very few Ou overruns. Saving
the raw usrp data in 'short' form halves the disk space/bus bandwidth that
the usual complex form uses.

3) Make pipes:

mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_1
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_2
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_3
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_4
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_5

4) In seperate windows run processes:

./interp_short.py <input rf data at 6.4Msps>
./xlate.py
./fpll.py
./btl-fsd.py
./viterbi-out.py <output mpeg transport stream>
