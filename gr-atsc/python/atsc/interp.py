# This module starts the atsc processing chain taking the captured
# off-air signal created with:
#
#  uhd_rx_cfile.py  --samp-rate=6.4e6
#                   -f <center of tv signal channel freq>
#                   -g <appropriate gain for best signal / noise>
#
# All this module does is multiply the sample rate by 3, from 6.4e6 to
# 19.2e6 complex samples / sec, then lowpass filter with a cutoff of 3.2MHz
# and a transition band width of .5MHz.  Center of the tv channels is
# then at 0 with edges at -3.2MHz and 3.2MHz.
